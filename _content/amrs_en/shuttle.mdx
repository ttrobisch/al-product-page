Optimal routes are planned to actively avoid obstacles. Thanks to its Load Handling Device (LHD), which can raise and lower the loading platform variably, the shuttle is able to effortlessly serve loading and unloading stations with different heights. These advanced features ensure smooth and effective handling of transport tasks. The shuttle thus offers a reliable solution for in-house material transport that combines flexibility, precision and optimized route planning.
