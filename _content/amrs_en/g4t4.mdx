The G4T4 - Mobile Cobots move autonomously and can seamlessly switch between different work areas, while also being able to transport material. These features enable full automation of handling and logistics processes.

The G4T4 - Mobile Cobot moves autonomously and can seamlessly switch between different work areas, while also being able to transport material. These features enable full automation of handling and logistics processes.

The collaborative robot arm mounted on the robot is specifically designed for human collaboration. In addition, the robots are equipped with collaborative end-of-arm tooling (EoAT) to make the applications even more diverse.

G4T4 - Mobile Cobots can be used in a wide range of applications, from machine tool handling applications to raw material and finished part transport, pick-and-place applications and warehouse picking. With the ability to move in any working environment, the G4T4 robot opens up new possibilities for the automation of production processes.
