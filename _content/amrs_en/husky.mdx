# Husky - Clearpath Robotics

## The Husky navigates agilely through rough terrain.

The Husky's elegant and simple design, made of durable materials with very few moving parts, makes this robot very low maintenance. Its powerful drivetrain and large lugged tyres allow Husky to tackle challenging terrain in the real world.

Thanks to its all-round vision with four cameras, Lidar sensors and GPS, Husky is perfect for patrolling rough terrain, where it can be controlled both autonomously and manually from a driver's cab. Husky is also suitable for tasks such as mapping, reconnaissance and inspection.
