# PA-AMR - Rapyuta Robotics

## Efficient order picking

Rapyuta's PA-AMR with integrated tablet and handheld scanner increases productivity in picking processes, reduce employee workload and mitigate labour shortages.

With the cloud robotics platform "rapyuta.io" and group control AI, multiple robots work together and use optimal routes to transport packages.

The staff follows the robot's instructions and thus performs picking tasks precisely and efficiently.

Because the system allows parallel processing with normal picking, it supports relatively large variations in material volume.
