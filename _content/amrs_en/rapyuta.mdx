    description: The Rapyuta has an attached tablet and barcode scanner. Both enable the employee to carry out pick-up work efficiently by means of specific instructions and to record these directly in the system. After loading, the Rapyuter takes over the transport independently.

Rapyuta's PA-AMR with integrated tablet and handheld scanner increases productivity in picking processes, reduce employee workload and mitigate labour shortages.

With the cloud robotics platform "rapyuta.io" and group control AI, multiple robots work together and use optimal routes to transport packages.

The staff follows the robot's instructions and thus performs picking tasks precisely and efficiently.

Because the system allows parallel processing with normal picking, it supports relatively large variations in material volume.
