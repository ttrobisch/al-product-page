# Dingo - Clearpath Robotics

## This robot reaches almost every goal

Dingo shows its strengths in indoor areas of buildings. With its light and compact design and the ability to move omnidirectionally, Dingo can reach almost any destination, even in environments with little space.

Dingo can carry loads of up to 20 kg and is very well qualified to pick up 3D maps.

The indoor robot offers easy and extensive expansion possibilities due to wide-ranging compatibility with third-party suppliers and flexible mounting options.
