The Crayler(BM214) from Palfinger is a truck-mounted forklift that is ready to operate in just 30 seconds. With its outstanding off-road capability and compact dimensions, it is a true gamechanger in the industry.

Thanks to autonomous navigation with laser scanners, the Crayler can be used both indoors and outdoors as well as in rough terrain. The device can thus carry out tasks independently and is extremely reliable in doing so. In addition, the Crayler can be easily integrated into existing logistics processes and thus ensures even more efficient warehousing and materials management.

Another plus point is the possibility of adaptation to individual needs and requirements. The Crayler can be adapted to different truck models and body variants and thus offers a customised solution for every customer.
